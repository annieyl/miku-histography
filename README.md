# <img src="https://media.tenor.com/CNNcfjuEpMQAAAAC/miku.gif" width="50"> miku-histography

an interactive history/timeline of vocaloid in the west! created for professor guan's class, east asian pop music (or general music 175), but also out of love for miku :3

### attributions

data on most viewed songs scraped from [vocaloard](https://vocaloard.injpok.tokyo/en/?d=2025-10&k=1&p=0), specifically from the top viewed songs for oct-nov 2025. miku lore learned from lurking around [r/Vocaloid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vocaloid/) but especially from u/Pompmaker1's [vocaloid history lesson](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CRk_L4CRLYWwtA9NSKKOCwOgZAAMlqzwbrbHzhzGcxc/edit?gid=0#gid=0) spreadsheet. additional knowledge supplemented from my own (significant) time spent on the internet in the 2010s, especially in the animation meme and art nerd community. loosely inspired by/referencing [histography.io](https://histography.io). am i writing a long paragraph for attributions because my code is broken and i'm procrastinating working on it? yes, yes i am.
